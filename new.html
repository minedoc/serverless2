<pre>
minimal sync
  no query
    map and filter the Dict yourself
  no realtime query
    re-query to get new values
  no ui toolkit
  no schema
    that's a bad idea
  no await
    everything done in-memory
    indexed db is best effort persistence
      how to guarantee it works
  leader election
    write to indexeddb = is leader
    do network receive as usual
    do not network send, direct channel to leader
  manual and code duplication
    local and remote changes are separate
  no dag
    don't need to save un-processable changes
    simple dependency model with no depth
    all needed data is in the change (eg table is duplicate)
    update depends on insert but can be resolved without it

how is old change handled
  bloom filter
  probability = keys^2/(2 * keyspace)
    bits = log2(keys^2 / probability) = 2 * log2(keys) - log2(probability)
